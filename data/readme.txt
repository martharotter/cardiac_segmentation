This dataset contains 360 subjects with diverse left ventricular and right ventricular pathologies.
The challenge 160 training subjects, 40 validation subjects and 160 testing subjects are included sequentally.
A csv with additional information about the pathologies, vendors, scanners and field strength is included.
You can find more information in the challenge webpage.

Please, take in consideration that NOR, HCM, and LV subjects are also included in the first edition of the challenge, with 3 considerations:

	- In the first version of the challenge, there are not long axis studies.
	- In the second verison of the challenge, long axis information was used to re-segment the short axis with more precision.
	- The mapping between both datasets is not availible, so is up to the user to make it. 
	  Please, note that the number of slices between the same subject in both datasets may vary in SIEMENS acquisitions.
